# Nutrition Application

## Opportunity 

### Problem
	- Nowadays, so many people aren't aware of what they are eating and what goes into their bodies. Most of the time, people are not getting enough nutrients. They may be meeting required calorie intake but they might not be getting enough macronutrients and micronutrients.

### Solution
	- This app will be designed to help people keep track of what they are eating. It will also tell them what nutrients they have eaten and what they still need to eat. Also, it will give some food suggestions depending on what else they should eat.

### Market
	- This app can be used by just about anyone who wants to track what they eat and ensure they are eating the proper vitamin and minerals in their diet.


## Key Features 
	- Want to be able to have people log in their food, and the app will give them a breakdown of what nutrients they eaten so far and what else they should eat.


## Competition
	- There are a lot of apps out there that track your macros, such as proteins, fats, and carbohydrates  but I'm looking to make something that's more specific to nutrients that you normally don't track, such as vitamins and minerals.

## Sketches of MVP
	- TBA

## Database Architecture
	- MySQL will be used because it allows for more organization.
	- Tables
		- Users
		- Food
		- Nutrients
	- Users and food tables will be linked because the food table will keey track of the foods that the user has eaten. The nutrients table will be linked to the food table, depending on what the food is
	- As the app grows, I do think that architecture will survive because as new users and new foods are added, it will continue to be added to the same tables.
